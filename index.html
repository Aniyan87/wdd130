            heritage, and ancient monasteries such as
            Geghard and Tatev. Mount Ararat, though located just across the border in Turkey, is a national symbol
            deeply tied to
            Armenian identity.Armenia is a land of breathtaking beauty, where rugged mountains, lush valleys, and
            ancient stone churches create a
